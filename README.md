# Stock Collector

These are some old Perl scripts that I wrote to webscrape stock data back from before I started grad school.

There are no instructions and I have no idea whether this still works. This was using MySQL.

You should look in `CollectorCommon.pm` to see what configuration options you need to change.

Some sample data is available here:
